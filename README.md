### Dynamic Charts
This website allows you to dynamically change the displayed charts using the URL.

To view a chart for a specific currency, simply append it to the URL like this:

https://johnnywaza.pythonanywhere.com/days=30&currencies=USD,CAD,ILS,EUR

You can add more currencies by separating them with commas (,). To remove a currency, simply remove it from the list in the URL.

Additionally, you can change the number of days displayed in the charts by appending days=<number> to the URL
